If you are using Jenkins for a while, you must be aware of the importance of jobs-related data and what can happen when the data is lost. 

The data loss can result from hardware or software failure, data corruption, a human-caused event, or accidental deletion of data.

The purpose of the backup is to create a copy of data that can be restored in the event of a primary data failure. 

Backup copies allow data to be restored from an earlier point to help the business recover from an unplanned event.
